@larrysing @Tactical_review @yournewswire I don't know about the Left.  Some people are not trustworthy with power.  They are fundamentally wicked.  This is not a matter of childish rantings about Left or Right. Instead, it is about human nature to do evil; to err.  Only a wicked people can have a wicked government.  ðŸ˜Œ
