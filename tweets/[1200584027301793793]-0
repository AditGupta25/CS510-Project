@ZellaQuixote @conspirator0 There is a resident baldy at a nearby lake; I've seen (him/her?) dive and carry off a fish a few times. And goldens have nested on a nearby butte; they're so big it's amazing. I've also found a few eagles dead on the side of the road, hit by cars when feeding on roadkill.
