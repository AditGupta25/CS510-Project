@AlexMasoorli @RoobNBCS Nah let’s talk about it. Wentz sacked drive ended, Wentz sacked again, punt, Wentz sacked again field goal, couldn’t recover onside. He was ass all 2nd half. Dolphins scored plenty points but where were the eagles points? Or is that the defense fault they couldnt get a 1st down?
