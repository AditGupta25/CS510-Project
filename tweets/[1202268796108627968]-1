@GentYour @heraclio_juarez @beasstify @RealSkipBayless @undisputed LOL You’re acting like he didn’t throw for over 500 yards and 3tds with Amendola, Hogan, and Edelman as WRs vs the eagles in the super bowl but lost because pats defense was ass. Go watch your cowboys lose, I doubt you even know what “touchdown” means
