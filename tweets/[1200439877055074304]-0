@miawgordon @weathernetwork @kathcupe The Eagles have landed Mia! ðŸ˜€ Along with the strong presence of Eagles in this nest area there is a growing number in the area at North 40 in #DeltaBC . Hint: During High Tide Eagles are ashore in greater numbers! @TourismDelta #BirdsOfPrey #birds #bird #nature #naturelovers https://t.co/8ot4j3gXXJ
