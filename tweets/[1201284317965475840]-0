@EricaStarno1984 At home we have a secured backyard so we can roam it. But at the lake there are coyotes, Eagles, bobcats &amp; more so we go on a leash. Remy actually like the leash more cause she can be outside w/ mum following her around. We trained mum to walk on a leash at 6 mos old. ðŸ˜º - Hazel
