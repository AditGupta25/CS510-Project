@SkudrisJohn @RoobNBCS Plenty of guys have had success at QB with never winning a superbowl. It's a team game, not a bowling competition.\n\nIf I knew winning a SB was going to make Eagles fans stupid and unrealistic...I still don't think I would have given it back...but I'd tell myself to be prepared.
