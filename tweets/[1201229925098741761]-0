Shasta will be turning 8 this year and we have had the time of our lives discovering #nature together almost every day. We've come across #bears #coyotes #skunks #racoons #Eagles and thousands of other #dogs to name a few things. Giving others space is a good thing eh Shasta! https://t.co/aJfD5hfzB1
